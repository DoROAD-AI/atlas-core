    **Response Structure**:

    Depending on the `type` parameter, the response will include matched results from the specified data domain(s):

    *   If `type=country`, the response will be:

        ```json
        [
          {
            /* Country data */
          },
        ]
        ```

    *   If `type=airport`, the response will be:

        ```json
        [
          {
            /* Airport data */
          },
        ]
        ```

    *   If `type` is omitted or set to `all`, the response will include both countries and airports:

        ```json
        {
          "countries": [
            {
              /* Country data */
            },
          ],
          "airports": [
            {
              /* Airport data */
            },
          ]
        }
        ```

    **Notes**:

    *   At least one query parameter (other than `type`) must be provided.
    *   If no matches are found, the API will return a `404 Not Found` response.
    *   Supports partial and case-insensitive matching where applicable.

    **Error Handling**:

    *   **400 Bad Request**: Returned if required parameters are missing or invalid.
    *   **404 Not Found**: Returned if no matching data is found.

## Building and Running Atlas v2.0 (Internal Instructions)

These instructions are for internal DoROAD teams building and running Atlas v2.0 from source.

### Prerequisites

*   **Go:** Version 1.20 or higher.
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **Docker (Optional):** For containerized deployment.
*   **Commercial License:** A valid commercial license for Atlas v2.0 is required.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DoROAD-AI/atlas.git
    cd atlas
    ```

2.  **Initialize Go Modules:**

    ```bash
    go mod init github.com/DoROAD-AI/atlas
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Install Swagger Tools (for documentation):**

    ```bash
    go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
    ```

### Configuring the Environment

Atlas uses environment variables for configuration.

1.  **`ATLAS_ENV`:** Sets the environment:

    *   `development`: For local development (default).
    *   `test`: For the test/staging environment.
    *   `production`: For the production environment.

2.  **`PORT` (Optional):** Sets the port the API will listen on (default: `3101`).

**Example:**

```bash
# For development on localhost:3101
export ATLAS_ENV=development

# For production, served on port 80
export ATLAS_ENV=production
export PORT=80
```

### Building and Running the API

**1. Building:**

```bash
go build -o atlas .
```

**2. Running:**

```bash
./atlas
```

Or use `go run` for development:

```bash
go clean
go build
go run main.go
```

**Generating Swagger Documentation:**

```bash
swag init
```

This will generate the `docs` folder with the Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation. You can access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:3101/swagger/index.html` (replace `3101` with your configured port if necessary).

### Docker Deployment (Optional)

1.  **Create a `Dockerfile`:**

    ```dockerfile
    FROM golang:1.20-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN go mod download
    RUN go build -o atlas .
    EXPOSE 3101
    CMD ["./atlas"]
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker Image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t atlas-v2 .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker Container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3101:3101 -e ATLAS_ENV=production atlas-v2
    ```

    *   `-p 3101:3101` maps port 3101 on your host to port 3101 inside the container.
    *   `-e ATLAS_ENV=production` sets the environment variable within the container.

## License

**Atlas v1** is licensed under the **MIT License**.

**Atlas v2 and later** are **proprietary** and require a **commercial license** from DoROAD. Please contact `support@doroad.ai` for information on obtaining a commercial license.
